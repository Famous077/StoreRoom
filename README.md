# 📚 StudyRoom & On-Chain Chatroom (Flare Network)

A beginner-friendly Solidity project that includes a simple **StudyRoom Smart Contract** and a fully decentralized **On-Chain Chatroom** built on the **Flare Coston2 Testnet**.  
This project is ideal for beginners learning smart contracts, arrays, state variables, and Web3 frontend integration.

## 📌 StudyRoom Smart Contract

A Solidity smart contract that allows users to join a virtual study room and post study-related messages stored directly on the blockchain.

### 🚀 What It Does
- Registers the deployer as the first member  
- Allows anyone to join the study room  
- Lets users post study notes/messages  
- Stores all member addresses in an array  
- Stores all messages on-chain  
- Provides public functions to check total members and messages  

### ⭐ Features
- ✔ No constructor input required  
- ✔ Beginner-friendly code  
- ✔ Public and transparent data  
- ✔ Great for learning Solidity arrays and state variables

# 💬 Decentralized On-Chain Chatroom (Flare Network)

A fully decentralized chatroom where users can join, send messages, and read the entire chat history — all stored permanently on-chain.

## 📖 Description
This chatroom demonstrates trustless and censorship-resistant communication on the Flare **Coston2 Testnet**.  
The frontend is built with **Next.js**, using **wagmi + viem** for seamless Web3 wallet and contract interaction.

---

# 🎯 Features

## 🔗 Smart Contract Features
- Join the chatroom (`joinRoom()`)
- Post messages (`postMessage(message)`)
- Fully decentralized and permanent message storage  
- View total number of members and messages  
- Retrieve any stored message by index  

## 🖥 Frontend Features
- Web3 wallet connection  
- Join room button with loading state  
- Message posting interface  
- Auto-updating message list  
- Shows transaction hash after message posting  
- Error + loading state management  

---

# 🛠 Why This Matters

### ✅ 1. Censorship-Resistant  
No admin can edit or remove messages — everything is stored immutably on-chain.

### ✅ 2. Transparent  
All chat history is publicly verifiable and accessible.

### ✅ 3. Trustless Interaction  
Users rely only on the smart contract, not a centralized server.

### ✅ 4. Great Web3 Learning Example  
Covers:
- Smart contract deployment  
- React + Web3 integration  
- wagmi hooks (read + write functions)  
- Waiting for tx confirmations  
- On-chain state rendering  

### ✅ 5. Real-World Use Cases
- DAO communication  
- Web3 community chatrooms  
- On-chain social platforms  
- Permanent proof-of-message apps

# 📌 Summary

This project demonstrates:
- Basics of Solidity smart contracts  
- How to store data on-chain  
- How to create a Web3-enabled frontend  
- How decentralized chatrooms can function in real life  

A simple but powerful example for learning Web3 development from scratch.
